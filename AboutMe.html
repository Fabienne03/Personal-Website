<h2>
    Personal Bio
</h2>
<p>
    As an African American young woman of Haitian descent, I have always been driven by a strong commitment to academics and community involvement. From a young age, I actively engaged in school through leadership roles and community service, which cultivated my passion for making a positive impact. My interest in technology began in middle school through participation in a STEM program, fueled by my love for math. This early exposure solidified my desire to pursue a career in tech, not only due to my genuine interest but also my dedication to addressing the gender gap in engineering fields—a cause I find both important and valuable to advocate for. <br> <br>

    Balancing my passion for technology with my feminine expression has been a unique challenge in the male-dominated STEM environment. Despite this, I embrace my identity as a "girly girl" who is equally enthusiastic about tech. Currently, as a college student, I am eager to explore new opportunities, continuously learn and grow along the way. This period of my life is marked by both expression and reflection as I navigate my path in the tech industry. <br> <br>

    My participation in the FIU Society of Women Engineers chapter has significantly contributed towards this. Fostering a community of women while, promoting their professional development has been admirable. Even more filling as an executive board member who is actively apart of new advancements and partnerships. Beneficial not only for myself but, many of our members within diverse communities. I am very proud and grateful for these opportunities Florida International University has introduced to me. I cannot wait to see where this new journey leads me.<br> <br>
</p>
<h2> Mission Statement</h2>
<p>As an aspiring software engineer and young black woman of Haitian descent, I am dedicated to breaking barriers in technology and creating a more inclusive future in STEM. With hard work, perseverance, and an unshakable belief in my ability to achieve anything I set my mind to, I strive to excel academically and professionally. I value education deeply and believe that with effort, time, and a willingness to learn, there are no limits to what I can accomplish. <br> <br>

    Guided by my faith and trust in God, I am committed to addressing the gender gap in STEM and encouraging more women to explore careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Through advocacy, mentorship, and outreach, I aim to inspire others to break boundaries and embrace their potential. <br> <br>

 My journey is fueled by the belief that with determination, education, and faith, anything is possible—and I am determined to make an impact in both my field and my community.
